Check list you can use

- Character has to have a reason to be on the ship, see the ship jobs to get an idea of what you could be doing

- You can have a feat for free, you can also ignore race restrictions in most cases. if it isn't in dnd beyond then ill add it in custom

- You can have a magic item, so long as it is "useless". by useless i mean cant be used in combat or similar aspects. but an item that your character might use in their everyday such as a little pen that can become an umbrella, endless lipstick, cloth that never gets dirty and so on.
