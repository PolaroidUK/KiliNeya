Aliases: God of Magic
Places of worship: Universities, Schools, Libraries
Arcan is the god of knowledge acquisition. He loves the gaining and maintenance of knowledge. 
Arcan is also known as the god of magic as he is one of two gods to have given up their celestial bodies. He dispersed his body across the entire world, allowing the living beings of the world to freely use his magic rather than having to worship him. This is the magic that wizards, sorcerers and other magic users draw upon.
