Kili is one of the two prime deities, often perceived as the mother of the gods, she with Neya bestowed the other gods with their powers. 

She is known as the Lightweaver. She spends her existence weaving a tapestry of souls, spinning threads a new thread as beings come to life, and cuts a thread when a being needs to pass on. Together with neya she maintains the balance of souls on the plane and works to keep other planes from destroying it.

She has an army of angels known as the Solstice Vanguard. As the lightweaver spins her threads she will see new-born souls that seem to have potential an gift them with her power. These people will grow up to be Aasimar, who will have until they are 25 to train and prove their skill and they will ascend into the Solstice Vanguard.
