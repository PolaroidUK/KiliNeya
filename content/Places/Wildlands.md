Wildlands is an area of east Kili'Neya which is inhabited by many tribes. 

## Before the Nova
The wildlands was an area ruled by no one, simply being inhabited by many tribes prescribed to the idea of the strongest shall lead. The tribes would mainly keep to themselves, except to join forces in repelling [[East Darley]] and [[Aldfield]] Soldiers from invading their lands.

## After the Nova
After the Nova some of the Tribes unified to be able to combat the masses amounts of magic creatures. Specifically in the centre of the wildlands a new city was formed around a ruin from [[Tilmere]] that now is the location for what many perceive as the capital of the Wildlands, [[Blackshaw Head]]. During this age of rebuilding a new organisation know as the hunters guild formed, to hunt and sell the magic beasts in the lands. This guild has grown in size and reach throughout the wildlands and its internal rules have largely been accepted as law even among none member. The guild now functions as a pseudo governmental agency for the king.
