Aasimar are being chosen by the [[lightweaver]], any species can be chosen by [[Kili]]. At birth these chosen ones appear with whiter skin or scales and around puberty will grow faster and typically larger than usual for that species. At 20 years old the Aasimar is fully grown and will be contacted by an angel from the Solstice Vanguard to guide the Aasimar through the next 5 years. The Aasimar then has 5 years to grow and perfect its craft to prove themselves to the Solstice council to be accepted and transcend at 25 years of age. If the Aasimar fails or renounce the trial they become fallen and liv the rest of their lives often in exile, disgrace or revelry.
